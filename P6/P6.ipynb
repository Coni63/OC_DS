It also has potential false positives if conda happens to be activated while you are using another Python installation.2: Check the executable pathThis will work in the case that users install anaconda/miniconda in the default path. It may fail otherwise. It's also easy to imagine false-positives.3. Check the version infoAs noted in the answers to any way to tell if user&#39;s python environment is anaconda, you can check the Python version string in some cases:This works currently for Python installed from the default channel, but this is quite brittle and may break in the future, particularly with Continuum's company name change.

       " 'How to explain \"git pull --rebase\" in simple terms? I think I understand  and this is how I explain it in, what I call, \"simple terms\":Generally speaking,  is about merging a \"remote\" branch into a \"local\" branch.In more detail, git uses the content of the \"remote\" branch to \"update\" / \"modify\" content of the \"local\" branch.In even more detail, if a file has been modified in the \"local\" branch but not in the \"remote\" branch, then after the merge, the content of the file will be the same as the content in the \"local\" branch. The opposite is also true. If a file was modified on the \"remote\" branch but not in the \"local\" branch, the content will be taken from the \"remote\" branch.If a file was modified in both branches (\"local\" and \"remote\") than git will try to take modifications from both branches. If the changes happen on different places of the file, both changes will be applied and be present in the content of the file after the merge.If the changes happen on the same place we have what is know as a \"merge conflict\" and I am not going to touch this case for simplicity.As a result of the merge, we modify the \"local\" repository and therefore we need to \"commit\".Now I want to get the same kind of explanation for . I do not want to use such terms as \"head\", \"index\", \"fetch\", \"upstream\" because these terms / concept only confuse beginners like me. I know that I need to learn these \"advanced\" concepts and I do it by reading tutorials but for now, as a part of my learning process, I want to understand .ADDEDI think at some point I heard the following explanation. By . When we merge, we do it not in a \"symmetric\" way, as described above. Instead, we first \"forget\" the changes in the \"local\" repository and apply only the changes from the \"remote\" repository. By doing that we basically \"copy\" the remote repository as it is. After that we apply the changes from the \"local\" repository on top. However, it is still not clear to me what exactly it means. In particular, what \"on top\" means.',\n",

It would update the result occasionally but only if it had subscribers.ProblemI'm not sure how I would mimic this same behavior with ngrx since ngrx handles the subscriptions to itself. In many ways it disconnects the subscription from the source. Here are some ideas I've mulled over:Maybe there is a way that I could duck punch  but then I think that I would have to define explicit relationships between effects and state that are already defined in the reducers.I could have each page/component register what it is interested in and track subscriptions that way but that is really just duplicating the subscriptions.I could setup projections for each slice of state that would sit in front of ngrx and somehow trigger the related effect but that seems tricky and possibly convoluted.Quit my job and sell pet rocks for a living.QuestionHow can I pull data on an interval to update an ngrx store only when there are active subscriptions on the related slice of data?\",\n",

The data will be cleaned before use to ensure that too.cheap isalways less than the bargain price. The cumulative frequency for thebargain price will be inverted to become not.bargain. The intersection of bargain and too.cheap will represent the point atwhich an equal share of respondents feel the price is not a bargainand too.cheap --- the point of marginal cheapness (\"pmc\").Getting to the point where I\\'m having a challenge will take a number of steps.Step 1: Generate some dataStep 2: Create a data frame of cumulative frequenciesStep 3: Estimate the curves for the cumulative frequenciesAt this point, we can plot and compare the \"observed\" cumulative frequencies against the estimated frequenciesThe estimate appears to fit the observations reasonably well.  Step 4: Find the intersection point for the two estimate functionsWe may visually test the so.pmc.x by plotting it with the two estimates.  If it is correct, a vertical line for so.pmc.x should pass through the intersection of too.cheap and not.bargain....which it does.Step 5: Find yHere is where I get stumped, and I\\'m sure I\\'m overlooking something very basic.If a curve is defined by f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-(a+bx))), and a, b and x are all known, then shouldn\\'t y be the result of 1/(1+exp(-(a+bx))) for either estimate?In this instance, it is not.EDIT: This is where the error occurs (see solution below).a != so.cof.NBr[1] and b != so.cof.NBr[2], instead a and be should be defined as the coefficients from so.temp.nls (not so.l) If we calculate the correct value for y, a horizontal line at yintercept = so.pmc.y, should pass through the intersection of too.cheap and not.bargain.   ...which it obviously does not.So how does one estimate y?',\n",

Each Grapevine has  collection of Grapes. Each fruit is another entity with just one String field. I\\'m creating user with 30 favorite fruits of each type and each grapevine has 10 grapes. So, totally I have 421 entity in DB - 30*4 fruits, 100*30 grapes and one user.And what I want: I want to load them using no more than 6 SQL queries. And each query shouldn\\'t produce big result set (big is a result set with more that 200 records for that example).My ideal solution will be the following:6 requests. First request returns information about user and size of result set is 1.Second request return information about Apples for this user and size of result set is 30.Third, Fourth and Fifth requests returns the same, as second (with result set size  = 30) but for Grapevines, Oranges and Peaches.

The result set is 30*30*30*30 and execution time is 10 seconds. Number of requests = 3. I tried it without grapes, with grapes you will get x10 size of result set. Just use lazy loading. This is the best result in this example (with @Fetch=SUBSELECT for grapes). But in that case that I need to manually iterate over each collection of elements. Also, subselect fetch is too global setting, so I would like to have something which could work on query level. Result set and time near ideal. 6 queries and 43 ms.Loading with entity graph. The same as fetch join but it also make request for every grape to get it grapevine. However, result time is better (6 seconds), but still awful. Number of requests > 30.I tried to cheat JPA with \"manual\" loading of entities in separate query. Like:SELECT u FROM User where id=1;SELECT a FROM Apple where a.user_id=1;This is a little bit worse that lazy loading, since it requires two queries for each collection: first query to manual loading of entities (I have full control over this query, including loading associated entities), second query to lazy-load the same entities by Hibernate itself (This is executed automatically by Hibernate)Execution time is 52, number of queries = 10 (1 for user, 1 for grape, 4*2 for each fruit collection)Actually, \"manual\" solution in combination with SUBSELECT fetch allows me to use \"simple\" fetch joins to load necessary entities in one query (like  entities) So I\\'m going to use it.

       " \"Why isn't there an endianness modifier in C++ like there is for signedness? (I guess this question could apply to many typed languages, but I chose to use C++ as an example.)Why is there no way to just write:to specify the endianness for specific members, variables and parameters?Comparison to signednessI understand that the type of a variable not only determines how many bytes are used to store a value but also how those bytes are interpreted when performing computations.For example, these two declarations each allocate one byte, and for both bytes, every possible 8-bit sequence is a valid value:but the same binary sequence might be interpreted differently, e.g.  would mean -1 when assigned to  but 255 when assigned to . When signed and unsigned variables are involved in the same computation, the compiler (mostly) takes care of proper conversions.In my understanding, endianness is just a variation of the same principle: a different interpretation of a binary pattern based on compile-time information about the memory in which it will be stored.It seems obvious to have that feature in a typed language that allows low-level programming. However, this is not a part of C, C++ or any other language I know, and I did not find any discussion about this online.UpdateI'll try to summarize some takeaways from the many comments that I got in the first hour after asking:signedness is strictly binary (either signed or unsigned) and will always be, in contrast to endianness, which also has two well-known variants (big and little), but also lesser-known variants such as mixed/middle endian. New variants might be invented in the future.endianness matters when accessing multiple-byte values byte-wise. There are many aspects beyond just endianness that affect the memory layout of multi-byte structures, so this kind of access is mostly discouraged.C++ aims to target an abstract machine and minimize the number of assumptions about the implementation. This abstract machine does not have any endianness.Also, now I realize that signedness and endianness are not a perfect analogy, because:endianness only defines how something is represented as a binary sequence, but now what can be represented. Both  and  would have the exact same value range.signedness defines how bits and actual values map to each other, but also affects what can be represented, e.g. -3 can't be represented by an  and (assuming that  has 8 bits) 130 can't be represented by a .So that changing the endianness of some variables would never change the behavior of the program (except for byte-wise access), whereas a change of signedness usually would.\",\n",

You could think of it as a particular case of a shift detection problem.Let\\'s consider the  variable in my set of measurements, identifying the elevation angle of the sun measured from the spacecraft\\'s instrument. For those who might want to play with the data, I saved the  file here.The scanline is my time dimension. The four points where the slope changes identify the spacecraft pitch rotations. As you can see, the solar elevation angle evolution outside the spacecraft manoeuvres regions is pretty much linear as a function of time, and that should always be the case for this particular spacecraft (except for major failures). Note that during each spacecraft manoeuvre, the slope change is obviously continuous, although discretised in my set of angle values. That means: for each manoeuvre, it does not really make sense to try to locate a single scanline where a manoeuvre has taken place. My goal is rather to identify, for each manoeuvre, a \"representative\" scanline in the range of scanlines defining the interval of time where the manoeuvre occurred (e.g. middle value, or left boundary).  Once I get a set of \"representative\" scanline indexes where all manoeuvres have taken place, I could then use those indexes for rough estimations of manoeuvres durations, or to automatically place labels on the plot.  My solution so far has been to:Compute the 2nd derivative of the solar elevation angle using.   Compute absolute value and clipping of resultingcurve.

In a sense, a given template parameter set describes an nearly-self-contained universe of classes, maybe with a one or two routes between these class universes.In current C++, I have no real way of grouping such 'class universes' together, except in a rather ugly and manual way.

It is, on the other hand, extremely ugly, and rather explicit for my liking.If templated namespaces existed in the C++ standard, I could do something a little nicer:Of course, templated namespaces don't exist in the C++ standard.

Is there a specific reason that this has not been adopted by the standard, or is it simply something that is yet to be proposed (in an effective manner)?I can see a variety of other use cases - for example, there are many generic libraries out there with a lot of focus on a single typedef template parameter, which could benefit from one overall parameter.\",\n",

       " \"How and why did the ISO C++ Standards Committee (WG21) decide to accept the proposal for a spaceship operator as it is? In a recently published paper [1], Herb Sutter et al. describe an extension of the programming language C++ by a three way comparison operator. The authors refer to a considerable number of earlier proposals, all of which were ultimately rejected.The clever core concept of the new approach is to encode different categories of relations in the return type of the comparison operator. The authors declare that   The primary design goal is conceptual integrity [Brooks 1975], which  means that the design is coherent and reliably does what the user  expects it to do.A total of five categories of comparison relations are introduced:If you are wondering, the authors justify their choice of words as follows:   I proposed these names instead of the standard mathematical terms  instead, because I have found that these are simpler to teach.From the text it can be deduced that  corresponds to equivalence,  to equality,  to weak order, and  to linear order. Unlike in the good old days [3], the authors unfortunately do not describe these terms axiomatically.This would have been particularly helpful in the case of .It turns out that  does not correspond to a partial order in the mathematical sense, since it does not impose anti-symmetry. Rather, it corresponds to a quasi-order.Both types of relations have practical applications.A widely used partial order is the subset relation. It is evidently reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric. Particularly, given sets A and B the proposition 'A ? B and B ? A' implies that A and B are equal (not just equivalent).It is a real tragedy that in a brand-new framework it is not possible to precisely represent the subset relation (or any other partial order).  For floating point types, we use  which supports both  signed zero and NaNs, with the usual semantics that   returns  and  returns .While the results of particular floating point comparisons are correctly depicted, the authors neglect the fact that this construction does not define any order at all, since it lacks reflexivity. Mathematical nonsense? Try sorting an array of floating point entities that contains NaN and enjoy undefined behavior!Further loopholes are introduced in section 2.5. A default template function implementation is provided for each of the comparison relation categories, in particular:Since this facility is a pure library extension, there is no need to worry about backward compatibility. The authors claim that   existing  usually tries to express a weak orderClearly, they understand that not every existing  actually expresses a weak order. Nevertheless, the default implementation of  falls back to legacy  and , and thus offers ample opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot at runtime.This completely undermines the core concepts and the honorable design goals of the proposal.According to [4], the ISO C++ Standards Committee (WG21) voted in favor of including the proposal in the C++20 Working Draft at its November 2017 meeting in Albuquerque.This leads to my question: Is the committee aware of the weak points and consciously accepts them or has it simply overlooked them?To be sure:I like the basic concept very much.I don't see any value in changing long-established terms.I refuse changing the meaning of common designations without any clear indication.I find it a pity that it is not intended to precisely represent partial orders.I find it unacceptable to unnecessarily expose users to the risk of latent runtime errors.A direct message to one of the authors a few months ago remained unanswered and disregarded.References[1] Herb Sutter, et al.: Consistent comparison.ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 document P0515R2 (pre-Albuquerque mailing), 2017\\x9609\\x9630.URL https://wg21.link/p0515r2[2] Walter E.

My issue is that I have a list populating with copies of the same data even though it seems to be generating completely different things each time a new object is created. When I attempt to debug, I encounter very strange behavior. This is my code:I have been using  in my constructor. When  is called,  will display one of two things. The first entry is always unique, then either a) the next 500-ish entries are one student and the rest are a second student, or b) the rest of the entries are alternating between two different students. However, when I go to debug, I can see that every new entry into  is unique, as it should be. Then, when I check how  is being populated, I find that same pattern of the first few being unique and the rest displaying only two different students. The actual act of debugging seems to affect this as well. For example, I will stop at the first breakpoint 20 times then let the program finish on its own until I reach the second breakpoint. As I stop on the second breakpoint, I find that each of those 20 students, plus another, display properly, then the following 979 follow that same pattern as earlier. I see this same effect no matter how many times I stop at the first breakpoint.I have tried searching the internet for similar instances of this behavior, but I am not getting anywhere, which is probably because I am not sure how to word this issue. When I search using the title I provided for this question, I do not get anything remotely related to my problem, so if any of you know of a similar issue, please point me in the right direction. My only thought is that this is an issue with memory allocation. The  method is using up a lot of memory with the lists I create before attempting to populate , so maybe the program is recycling the same memory address for each new , and since  is really just a list of memory addresses, it ends up with repeats of the same addresses. C# does not seem to have a nice way of giving me the memory address of an object, so I haven't been able to confirm that.

My widget is going to be written in React. I know several ways to achieve this. Let me list the ways that I could think of.Give a code snippet with directly iframe and source url in it. Problem with this approach is, it can be used only if the widget is embed. If the widget needs to be popup, flexibility will be lost.Give a code snippet with a javascript being loaded asynchronously. Javascript will create an iframe in the parent webpage and src can be set. This widget javascript can have little intelligence. This is the usual approach followed by most of the widget developers.Of course, source URL will render a React page which is bundled by webpack, in either case.I wanted to know the best practices of developing a widget. So I went through the popular implementations of it. I liked Intercom's widget very much. It is written in React. I analyzed how it works. The minimal javascript is loaded async on the webpage. It is injecting an  with id . That  has a script in it's head with a source URl. Obviously it is React bundle. The thing that I don't understand is, below this , a  is created with three  in it. One to show the chat bubble, another to show the chat bubble icon, the last one to show the actual chat window. Those  doesn't have source url and I guess the bundle is served from the first iframe created by the widget javascript. I came across this SO question, which partially answers my question. From the answer,   expose some API between your customer webpage and your iframe, using window messaging.    the main code (the iframe code) is then loaded by this first script  asynchronously, and not included in it.What I don't understand is, 1.) How they would have achieved it with window messaging?2.) How they would have managed to create a  with s in it, from another s script?. Widget javascript is not creating those elements, based on it's source. It should have been done by the React bundle in the iframe generated by widget js. 3.)

Another example would be , which is the triangle in the first quadrant that is bounded by the blue, red and green lines.An example of a non partition would be , which is the set bounded by the green line above and the blue line below.

I have read about this problem quite often so far and it also occurs for my own projects. Here is an introduction of what I have found out so far about the srcset and the sizes attribte.There are two different possibilities on how to use the -attribute (source w3c: http://w3c.github.io/html/semantics-embedded-content.html#device-pixel-ratio):Device-pixel-ratio-based selection when the rendered size of the image is fixedThis is a simple and reliable way to use . You simply say: If the device-pixel ratio of the target devicer is bigger than x, display this image with the following higher resolution.  The x descriptor is not appropriate when the rendered size of the  image depends on the viewport width (viewport-based selection), but  can be used together with art direction.Example:Viewport-based selectionThis method allows you to display different image sizes depending on the size of your viewport. This is the method you are primarily using within your example.  The srcset and sizes attributes can be used, using the w descriptor,  to provide multiple images that only vary in their size (the smaller  image is a scaled-down version of the bigger image).Simple example:One step further: Using the sizes attributeThe default for Viewport-based selection and srcset is, that the image always has 100% width (). The sizes attribute is giving the great possibility to tell the browser, how the width of an image is at a certain screen width.  The sizes attribute sets up the layout breakpoints at 30em and 50em,  and declares the image sizes between these breakpoints to be 100vw,  50vw, or calc(33vw - 100px). These sizes do not necessarily have to  match up exactly with the actual image width as specified in the CSS.    The user agent will pick a width from the sizes attribute, using the  first item with a  (the part in parentheses) that  evaluates to true, or using the last item (calc(33vw - 100px)) if they  all evaluate to false.Example:Here is the challange where I would be really glad if someone could enlighten meCan I rely on srcset that a Client always load the correct image? Or is the actually loaded image also depending on processing power and internet connection speed as some people stated? I had complaints about retina devices which load lower resolution images.How can I use both: Device-pixel-ratio-based and viewport-based selection together? Because for each possible size in sizes, I may want to define a retina image with 200% size as well as a non-retina image.And furthermore: Does it make sense to use different images within srcset for different viewport sizes or is this a misuse of the srcset attribute? If it is possible to combine device-pixel-ratio-based and viewport-based selection, this should also be possible.',\n",

In short, we are seeing a massive drop in performance when utilizing .Utilizing EFCache.Enabled db model caching running EF 6.2.Making use of cached views.Using a context without Lazy Loading where possible utilizing the correct (and minimal) includes.Using  for read-only data.Using a context without proxy generation nor autodetect changes (though the latter appears to be a minimal improvement).Context lifetime is minimal, single query within using blocks where possible.Clean constructors on the objects so EF should experience minimal overhead in mapping the data to objects.\"Async all the way\" which certainly improved responsiveness, but does not reduce the work being done.Current (presumed) issues we still have that could have an impact:Primary key, clustered GUIDs.Table per type hierarchy, with Entity being part of it, potentially causing double joins.Most of the related topics we\\'ve already burned through, without much effect. As far as we can tell, the database is \\'okay\\'. Utilizing a log4net interceptor before the queries hit the database, we found out that although some of our queries with 3-7 includes are monstrous, they aren\\'t abysmally slow: times ranging from 0ms to 100ms. It tends to be 2000ms up to 8000ms until the objects are \\'ready\\' for use though.We have at most 50.000 entities currently in our database. However, even with a near-clean database, there is minimal difference.Code(Simplified, extracted) model structure:(Simplified) slow query, taking two seconds on average, but a few ms based on log4net:We\\'ve tried alternative approaches:SummaryBased on the provided information, does anyone see a clear issue which we may have missed, or otherwise have suggestions for things we could try?Could the fact that we still have the two aforementioned \\'issues\\' present dether EF from constructing the objects in a semi-fast way?Perhaps relevant, using  instead of  blocks and does not appear to finish within a reasonable period.Update 1In response to @Ivan Stoev - running the above query ran for 98ms (2968ms) and generated the following (full) SQL statement:Update 2In response to @grek40 - the interceptor we have in place adds to each select query to make sure the entities we are receiving do not have the flag . It is joining the Entities table for every object + include, and thus the above query shows 3 additional joins. If we disable the interceptor, we are left with 4 joins instead of 7. We didn\\'t think much of it, but now that we\\'ve disabled it, the calculated time for the query above, through Entity Framework, went from ~3 seconds to ~2 seconds. It appears to have been accountable for 1/3rd of the performance issues we\\'re seeing.',\n",

But is it mandated by the standard?The standard (C++14, n4296) says that every enumeration has an underlying type (7.2/5). The standard also says that objects are represented as sequences of bytes, and that the size of an object is related to its representation:  3.9/4 The object representation of an object of type T is the sequence of N  unsigned char objects taken up by the object of type T, where N equals  sizeof(T).    5.3.3/1 The sizeof operator yields the number of bytes in the object  representation of its operand.However, I was not able to find any relation between an enum's underlying type and the object representation. Is there any? If not, than I would argue that sizeof of an enumeration does not have to be sizeof of its underlying type.So my questions are:Is there any relation between an enum's underlying type and its object representation?Does the standard really require that  for any enumeration E?\",\n",

So i get this teacher object, and inside the object are these reference id's that i need to replace with the actual object, the problem being that they are nested objects. What i currently do is create a stack, and traverse the objects to find these id's and reference id's. When i find an id i put it on the stack.

That causes that the query marked by (A) returns null in thread T2 that was blocked by synchronisation block and entered it before T1 finished executing service method. This leads to a structure like this:Instead ofMy assumption was that in (B) at the end of  data will be persisted and then parallel session, running in T2 would get the data using the query.However this does not happen.What did I miss?EDIT: Clearing the session at the beginning and flushing at end of synchronised section has no effect.EDIT 2: Hibernate 3.6 is used with Grails.

Basically, the user inputs a single-syllable name/noun, and based on that word, the rhyming poem will spawn. The logic for that first bit goes as follows:Step one: get user\\'s inputStep two: figure out how long user\\'s input is (this step might not actually be necessary)Step three: find first vowel (only including \"y\" if it\\'s the onlyvowel-- alternatively, only include \"y\" if it\\'s the last letter)Step four: select all of the letters including and after thatvowelStep five: compare those letters to possible end rhymesThe problem is, I\\'m not sure how to handle steps three and four. (I\\'m open to solutions using jQuery or javascript libraries, but since I\\'m still a beginner, I haven\\'t branched out much into writing anything but straight javascript from scratch.NB: If an upper limit for length is helpful, nine characters would make sense, since the longest one-syllable words in the English language are 9 letters long.  My first thought was to do a conditional statement, something like:In theory (at least I think-- please correct me if I\\'m wrong), that gets me as far as finding the first time a/e/i/o/u/word-terminal-y shows up, and then pulls the substring to compare to the various end rhymes... but then I\\'m lost.

I\\'m trying to avoid having a conditional statement with a hundred or more conditions if at all possible.Any assistance or critique would be most welcome!Edit for examples:Some examples of what I mean by a \"list of possible end rhymes\":\"ay\" as in \"bay\": [ay, eigh, ei]\"i\" as in \"by\": [y, eye, aye, ye]\"ah\" as in \"saw\": [a, ah, aw]\"ot\" as in \"bot\": [ot, ott, ought, aught]Logical workthrough using an example:Pre-requisite: User input: \"Scott\"Step 1: Get user input [Result: \"Scott\"]Step 2: Find length of user\\'s input [Result: 5 characters long, aka has positions 0-4]Step 3: Find location of first vowel [Result: first vowel is \"o\" at position 2]Step 4: Select all letters after and including that vowel [Result: returns substring \"ott\"]Step 5: Compare substring to possible end rhymes/spellings (Result: returns variable match for the \"ot\" end rhyme)Step 6: Limit terminal-word choices for lines 3, 5, and 7 to subset of words with \"ot\" end rhyme [NB: this would be a pre-selected library of words already identified with that rhyme scheme]My major roadblock is comparing the selected substring \"ott\" to my collection of possible end rhymes.

       " 'What specifically marks an x86 cache line as dirty - any write, or is an explicit change required? This question is specifically aimed at modern x86-64 cache coherent architectures - I appreciate the answer can be different on other CPUs.If I write to memory, the MESI protocol requires that the cache line is first read into cache, then modified in the cache (the value is written to the cache line which is then marked dirty). In older write-though micro-architectures, this would then trigger the cache line being flushed, under write-back the cache line being flushed can be delayed for some time, and some write combining can occur under both mechanisms (more likely with writeback). And I know how this interacts with other cores accessing the same cache-line of data - cache snooping etc.My question is, if the store matches precisely the value already in the cache, if not a single bit is flipped, does any Intel micro-architecture notice this and NOT mark the line as dirty, and thereby possibly save the line from being marked as exclusive, and the writeback memory overhead that would at some point follow?As I vectorise more of my loops, my vectorised-operations compositional primitives don\\'t explicitly check for values changing, and to do so in the CPU/ALU seems wasteful, but I was wondering if the underlying cache circuitry could do it without explicit coding (eg the store micro-op or the cache logic itself). As shared memory bandwidth across multiple cores becomes more of a resource bottleneck, this would seem like an increasingly useful optimisation (eg repeated zero-ing of the same memory buffer - we don\\'t re-read the values from RAM if they\\'re already in cache, but to force a writeback of the same values seems wasteful). Writeback caching is itself an acknowledgement of this sort of issue.Can I politely request holding back on \"in theory\" or \"it really doesn\\'t matter\" answers - I know how the memory model works, what I\\'m looking for is hard facts about how writing the same value (as opposed to avoiding a store) will affect the contention for the memory bus on what you may safely assume is a machine running multiple workloads that are nearly always bound by memory bandwidth.

I am following this article for revoking user access :http://bitoftech.net/2014/07/16/enable-oauth-refresh-tokens-angularjs-app-using-asp-net-web-api-2-owin/Now consider after validating user I have issued an accesstoken with 30 minutes life span as shown in above article and with refresh token as 1 day but what if admin delete that user in 10 minutes with 20 minutes still left so now in this case I need to revoke access that user.In order to do this I need to remove that user entry from refresh token table to disallow further access token request but as accesstoken expire time is still having 20 minutes so user would be able to access protected resource which is completely wrong.So I was thinking to implement caching mechanism to cache the access token on server and also save in database. So when that user is revoked I can simply remove that user entry from cache and database to stop that user access from accessing protected resource.But this 2 below answers are saying this is not how oauth2 was designed : Revoke access token of OAuthBearerAuthenticationOAuth2 - unnecessary complexity with refresh tokenSo my question is  :1) Why caching access token is not considered better than refresh token mechanism and also a bad approach?My second question is based on this below answer given by @Hans Z. in which he is saying that :  This necessarily would involve the Resource Server (RS) consulting the  Authorization Server (AS) which is a huge overhead.2)  In case of revoking access for a user why does RS would consult AS because AS is just for authenticating user and generating access token as per this Article?3)  In the article there are only 2 projects :Authentication.api - Authenticating user and generating access tokenResource server - validating accesstoken with the help of    attributeIn above case which is the authorisation server then? Update : I have decided to use refresh token to revoke user access in case user is deleted and also when user logout i will refresh token from refresh token table because of your requirement that we want to logout user immediately as soon as user clicks on logout.But here the problem is i have 250 roles associated with user so if i put roles in accesstoken then size of accesstoken will be so huge and we cannot pass such huge accesstoken from header but i cannot query roles for validating user access for endpoints each time that endpoint is called.So this is 1 another problem which i am facing.',\n",

       " 'Optimal approach for large bulk updates to indexed bit sets The environment for this question is PostgreSQL 9.6.5 on AWS RDS.The question is about an optimal schema design and batch update strategy for a table with 300 million rows containing the following logical data model:: primary key, string up to 40 characters long: integer 1-999: integer yearflags: variable number (1000+) each associated with a name, new flags added over time. Ideally, a flag should be thought of as having three values: absent (), on (/) and off (/). It is possible, at the cost of additional updates (see below), to treat a flag as a simple bit (on or off, no absent). \"On\" values are typically very sparse: &lt; 1/1000. Queries typically involve boolean expressions on the presence or absence of one or more flags (by name) with  and  occasionally involved also.The data is updated in batch via Apache Spark, i.e., updates can be represented as flat file(s), e.g., in COPY format, or as SQL operations. Only one update is active at any one time. Updates to  and  are very infrequent. Updates to flags affect 1-5% of rows per update (3-15 million rows). It is possible for the update rows to include all flags and their values, just the \"on\" flags to be updated or just the flags whose values have changed. In the former case, Spark would need to query the data to get the current values of flags.There will be a small read load during updates.The question is about an optimal schema and associated update strategy to support the query &amp; updates as described.Some comments from research so far:Using 1,000+ boolean columns would create a very efficient row representation but, in addition to some DDL complexity, would require 1,000+ indexes.Bit strings would be great if there was a way to index individual bits. Also, they do not offer a good way to represent absent flags. Using this approach would require maintaining a lookup table between flag names and bit IDs. Merging updates, if needed, works with , though, given PostgreSQL\\'s MVCC there doesn\\'t seem to be much benefit to updating just flags as opposed to replacing an entire row.JSONB fields offer indexing. They also offer  representation but that comes at a cost: all flags that are \"off\" would need to be explicitly set, which would make the fields quite large. If we ignore  representation, JSONB fields would be relatively small. To further shrink them, we could use short 1-3 character field names with a lookup table. Same comments re: merging as with bit strings./: have no experience with this data type but, in theory, seems to be an exact representation of a set of \"on\" flags by name. Must use a lookup table mapping flag names to tokens with the additional requirement to ensure there are no collisions due to stemming.',\n",

If you try to commit a transaction after  (and prior to a following  or , you will get an error.Reading the documentation for , I see  You will receive this call immediately before  when your activity is re-starting.This leads me to believe that it should be safe to execute these transactions in , as  will have already been called, putting me inside the safe window.I made an app to test this out, and I'm successfully seeing dialog fragments that I create and commit inside . I had the same app also log the activity lifecycle callbacks so I could inspect their order, and I see , then , and then  every time.Am I missing something? Or has the framework changed and  is now guaranteed to be a safe place for fragment transactions? Does this behavior vary by API level?I found another question and answer that seems to read the documentation the same way I have, but both are over a year old and neither specifically refers to  as a safe place for transactions.\",\n",

The images that will be displayed in the container are different sizes and applied as background images, rather than  elements inside the container so that:I can swap the set of images as needed via media queriesThe background can be animated to produce the slideshow effectI have  and  and these are correctly keeping the image within the desired area of the container, ensuring that excess is clipped off properly.The first issue is that during the CSS animation, when one image transitions to another, the new image is resized over the course of that keyframe's timing. What I would like is for the next image to just be transitioned to (at the proper size already), without seeing it resize.Actually, I'm not even sure why there is a cross-fade visualization in the first place, since I have no instructions to do that (perhaps a built-in  animation?). I would have thought that you would just see an immediate change from one image to the next. I actually like the cross-fade, but not knowing where it's coming from makes me think it's related to the resizing issue.The second issue is that during the first iteration (only) of the slide show, there is a flickering of the images and the white background color of the container element is shown briefly. Because this only happens on the first iteration, I thought that perhaps it was an issue with the initial download times for the images and that's why it goes away on subsequent iterations. However, that proved not to be the case when I added some JavaScript to preload the images before the slide show starts and found the same issue. Also, once you run the show, you have the images in your cache and when you refresh the page (which will just get the images from your cache and yes, I am testing this by getting the file from my own test server so they will cache properly) the flicker happens again.I've seen some posts about eliminating the flicker with various CSS property settings using  and such, but none of that helped.I'm using Chrome 62.0.3202.94 desktop on Windows 10.I realize I could side-step these issues using other various techniques (i.e. JavaScript, stacking  elements and managing , etc.), but I am really trying to understand what is causing these two issues.\",\n",

To my surprise, the performance of the code written in vanilla Python ended up being far higher than that of the code written using Pandas.As my handcoded data processing code is substantially bigger and messier than the original Pandas code, I haven\\'t quite given up on using Pandas, and I\\'m currently trying to optimize the Pandas code without much success.The core of the data processing step consists of the following: I first divide the rows into several groups, as the data consists of several thousand time series (one for each \"individual\"), and I then do the same data processing on each group: a lot of summarization, combining different columns into new ones, etc.I profiled my code using Jupyter Notebook\\'s , and the bulk of the time is spent on the following and other similar lines:...a mix of vectorized and non-vectorized processing. I understand that the non-vectorized operations won\\'t be faster than my handwritten for loops, since that\\'s basically what they are under the hood, but how can they be so much slower? We\\'re talking about a performance degradation of 10-20x between my handwritten code and the Pandas code.Am I doing something very, very wrong?',\n",

The way  dispatches to different visitor methods when  is called is pretty reasonable when the variant alternatives are completely different types. Essentially a visitor-specific  is built at compile-time and after some error checking1 the appropriate visitor function is looked by indexing the table based the current  which resolves to something like an indirect jump on most platforms.If the alternatives share a common base class, however, calling a (non-virtual) member function or accessing state on the base class with a visitor is conceptually much simpler: you are always calling the same method and usually using the same pointer2 to the base class.Still, the implementation ends up just as slow. For example:The generated code on x86 for the most recent version of  and  is similar3 (clang shown):The  is the actual indirect call to a function pointed to by the vtable (the vtable itself appears at the bottom of the listing). The code before that is first checking the \"is empty\" state, and then setting up the  call (I\\'m not sure what the weirdness with  is, I guess it\\'s setting up a pointer to the visitor as the first argument or something).The actual methods which are pointer to by the vtable and executed by the  are very simple, a single  to read the member. Critically, both are indentical:So we have a huge mess. To execute that single  we have a dozen setup instructions, and more importantly an indirect branch: which if targeting a series of   objects with different contained alternatives will mispredict very badly. Finally, the indirect call seems like an insurmountable barrier to further optimization: here will look at a simple call without any surrounding context, but in real use this might be optimized into a larger function with significant opportunities for further optimization - but I think the indirect call will block it.You can play with the code yourself on godbolt.Versus a UnionThe slowness isn\\'t inherent: here\\'s a very simple \"discriminated union\"  that combines the two classes in a  along with an  discriminator that keeps track of what class is contained:The corresponding  function compiles down to a single  instruction on both gcc and clang:Granted, the discriminated union doesn\\'t have to check the \"is valueless\" error condition, but that\\'s not the main reason for  slowness and in any case such a condition is impossible with  and  since none of their constructors throw4. Even if you wanted to support such a state, the resulting function with the  is still very efficient - only a small check is added, but the behavior of calling the base class is the same.Is there anything I can do to this use of  efficient in this case of calling a common base class function, or is the promise of a zero-cost abstraction just not panning out here?I\\'m open to a different call pattern, compiler options, whatever. 1 In particular, checking whether the variant is  due to an earlier assignment that failed.2 The pointer to the base class doesn\\'t always have the same relationship to the most derived pointer for all alternatives, e.g., when multiple inheritance is involved.3 Well  is a bit worse since it seems to redundantly perform the \"is valueless\" check both upfront prior to the call to  and also in each auto-generated method pointed to by the . clang only does it upfront. Keep in mind when I say \"gcc\" I really mean \"gcc with libstdc++\" while \"clang\" really means \"clang with libc++\". Some differences, like the redundant  check in the generated visitor functions are likely due to library differences rather than compiler optimization differences.4 If the  state is problematic, one could also consider something like  which never has an empty state but still uses local storage if the move constructor cannot throw.',\n",

This is the assignment:  Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.    In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.    The following variables contain values as described below:    balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card    annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal    The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example:    Lowest Payment: 180  Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:    Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0  Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)  Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)This is my code:Here are the test results: (I have here all 15, so you might be able to identify a pattern I can\\'t see.

With a few days of research I concluded that  is the way to go, because its handlers allow me to process the file chunk-by-chunk.I followed the examples, and with some hours of trial and error I wrote the Perl code that performed the job I needed to do. The code worked, it extracted the data I wanted and calculated the details I needed. But while running the script (took about 15 minutes to process the 620MBs XML) I noticed in Activity Monitor that towards the end the memory usage quickly increases to an unreasonably high level.I removed the Perl code that processes the XML tag I was interested in and replaced it with a single instruction to increment a variable, simply counting how many of  elements had been found. The memory usage was similar. First normal, then towards the final few elements it started to rapidly increase and eat up everything I have.I added some code to monitor time, the number of items processed, and how much memory my Perl process is using. This code is shown here:And here is what was shown on the screen when I run the above script.  Notice the 3 minutes gap where \"Parse finished\" is printed.I expected to see the memory usage go up for the final few product tags, just like I have seen it in Activity Monitor. But the memory usage printed\\x97up to the very last product tag\\x97was a perfectly acceptable 15 MB. The tricky part is not shown in this output: only the missing 3 minutes time and the 3780M indicates that something odd happens right after the final product tag.  So I wrote a shell script to keep track of memory usage during those missing 3 minutes at the end too. Here is what I was running in a separate window while the perl script was processing the XML in its own window.  And here is the output of that shell script running while the perl script was processing the XML:  Notice the increase of memory usage at 23:51:54. That is when the 3-minute gap in the other output starts. And memory usage is rapidly going up from there.I am puzzled as to what causes this rapid increase of memory usage at the end of processing the last (119,335th) product tag. And whatever it is, why does it use so much memory? 3.5G instead of the 15M, that is not OK.Am I doing something wrong?Any suggestion on how to avoid the memory usage increase?Added later, in response to the answers my original post received.  SupplementSwitching to twig_roots.I modified the twig handler block by commenting out the handler definition and adding its twig_roots variety instead, as shown here:  I left the  instruction inside my sub.Here is the output of the perl script:  And here is the output of the monitoring shell script:  The good news is that using the twig_roots approach instead of a twig handler makes my perl code behave as I wanted it. It goes through a giant XML file end extracts data from each product (the extracted data is not in XML format) while the amount of memory used stays below 20 megabytes. Splendid!The bad news is that I am still unable to explain why using the handler ate up that much memory, and why it did that after the last product was read. Up to the last product, memory usage was perfectly fine. What made it go out of control at that point? I will make some more tests to try and satisfy my curiosity, but that is no longer tied to the issue of how my XML-processing perl code development moves forward. I am marking the twig_roots suggestion as an accepted answer, but I very much appreciate the other answer too as that one was equaly educational to work with.',\n",

       " \"Why are C++ classes with virtual functions required to have a non-trivial copy constructor? According to the C++ standard, a class that has virtual functions cannot have a trivial copy constructor:  A copy/move constructor for class X is trivial if it is not user-provided and if    \\x97 class X has no virtual functions (10.3) and no virtual base classes (10.1), and    \\x97 the constructor selected to copy/move each direct base class subobject is  trivial, and    \\x97 for each non-static data member of X that is of class type (or array thereof), the constructor selected to copy/move that member is trivial;    otherwise the copy/move constructor is non-trivial. Now, imagine a class hierarchy that satisfies all the mentioned conditions except the 'no virtual functions' condition:From an implementation's point of view those classes contain only a pointer to the virtual dispatch table. And the base class does not have any user-declared constructors, and the derived class is final, so the mentioned pointer can always have a constant value. Given all that, the copy constructor can be trivial, yet the standard explicitly forbids treating it as such.On the other hand, the conditions of treating such classes as trivially destructible are met. The class does not declare a virtual destructor and uses implicitly-defined destructors.Requiring triviality of destructors looks like mandating an optimization - implicitly defined destructors should not restore pointers to the virtual table in this case. But such an optimization goes half-way in my opinion; classes with virtual functions still cannot be memcopied, even if they can be trivially destructed.The questions:Are there any reasons I did not think of from an implementation perspective why such classes should have non-trivial copy-constructors?Are there any reasons the restrictions on triviality for copy-constructors cannot be relaxed in the standard?  \",\n",

So the structure and Reducers follow the typical 'slice reducer' pattern and will look like this:We are using combine reducers to merge the reducers before passing them into the store.  Theoretical use case: We have a 'products' page that shows a list of basic product info. A user can click on a product to show a modal which then loads and shows the complete product data.For the above example, the state sent from the server will contain only basic product models (3 or 4 fields), this is enough to render the table and fetching all product information at this point is wasteful and not very performant.When a user clicks a product we will do an AJAX call fetch all data for that product. Once we have all data for the single product, should we update the instance in the products store with a full model? If so, we would then end up with a set of objects all of which could be different states (some could have minimal fields vs some which are full-blown objects with 10s of fields). Is this the best way to handle it?Also, I would be interested to hear any thoughts of managing different representations of the same underlying model on the server and how to map it to the Redux store (in Java ideally).\",\n",

The following code will compile and run fine in clang but will crash when compiled with VS2015 (in the second block) or VS2017 (in the third block):I have tried to make the differences visible by generously using newlines.The problem seems to be that in the MS implementation, the destructor of the promise object inside the lambda function tries to update the shared state with a  'broken promise' exception even if set_value_at_thead_exit() was called. However, this fails and throws a system error in turn. It happens while trying to lock the associated mutex.If set_value_at_thread_exit() is not called, f.get() throws a future_error as expected. Looking inside the MS implementation (VS2017) I found code that pretends to check whether the shared state is ready at thread exit but does nothing. So I am wondering whether this is a bug or whether I misunderstood the API and am supposed to ensure that the lifetime of the promise extends beyond the thread exit. The latter seems to be what is happening in VS2017 in the second code block but not in VS2015 - probably due to implementation differences of std::thread?!As mentioned above, the code runs fine in clang: http://rextester.com/FEZDS24592gcc: http://rextester.com/WFKE61563but crashes inthe second block in VS2015: http://rextester.com/NODVFO14840and the third block in VS2017. This can be tested here: http://webcompiler.cloudapp.net/So basically I wonder whether I should file an issue or whether I will just be making a fool of myself because I am using the language all wrong?Thanks\",\n",

This is understandable, because the underlying data in  occupies a contiguous block of memory.My question is, will removing rows/columns cause similar issues? For example, to remove the second row of :Is this operation in-place or not? I really feel unsure, since for one thing it doesn't seem to make any new room for data in the memory, and for another, the rows of  will be stored non-contiguously (since row 2 is removed).So what will happen internally? And is this operation efficient enough to use in practice? Thanks!Just tested it with a complexity of :And Results: 0.009s for the first (modifying preallocated matrix) and 53.429s for the second (removing rows from a matrix). I think this basically settles this question: NO, removing rows/columns from a matrix is NOT efficient to use, since it definitely involves deepcopying data and reallocating memory.Also, removing columns instead of rows isn't a good idea either. As I tested, it still takes as good as approx two minutes, on the above complexity scale:So, end of the story: Don't try to remove columns or rows in this way, unless you have a really small matrix.

It involves creating a three-layerhandler: with automatic decompression disabled.A new handler which replaces the content stream with a new  subclass which delegates to the original content stream, but hashes the data as it's read.A decompression-only handler, based on the Microsoft  code.While this works, it has disadvantages of:Open source licensing: checking exactly what I need to do in orderto create a new file in my repo based on the MIT-licensedMicrosoft codeEffectively forking the MS code, which means I should probablymake a regular check to see if any bugs have been found in itThe Microsoft code uses internal members of the assembly, so itdoesn't port as cleanly as it might.If Microsoft made  public, that would help alot - but that's likely to be in a longer timeframe than I need.What I'm looking for is an alternative approach if possible -something I've missed that lets me get at the content beforedecompression. I don't want to reinvent  - the responseis often chunked for example, and I don't want to have to get intothat side of things. It's a pretty specific interception point thatI'm looking for.\",\n",
